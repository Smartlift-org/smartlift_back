# üéØ TICKET #001: AI-Powered Workout Routine Generation

**Status:** üìã Ready for Development

## üßæ **Title**
**Integrate AI-powered Workout Routine Generation**

---

## üìã **Description**

Implement a backend service in Ruby on Rails that generates a weekly workout routine using a language model (GPT-based). The service should accept user fitness data, send a structured prompt to an external prediction API, and return a JSON routine along with an explanation in Spanish.

This feature will allow users to get personalized workout routines based on their fitness profile, available equipment, and goals, powered by AI and using the existing exercise database.

---

## üéØ **Goal**

Create an endpoint that:

1. ‚úÖ Accepts user fitness data as JSON input
2. ‚úÖ Builds a formatted prompt (in English, with preferences/goal in Spanish)
3. ‚úÖ Sends the prompt to an AI inference API (e.g., Replicate/OpenRouter)
4. ‚úÖ Parses the AI response to extract:
   * A `<explicacion>` block in Spanish
   * A `<json>` block with the weekly routine
5. ‚úÖ Returns both blocks to the frontend or stores them if needed
6. ‚úÖ Validates exercise IDs against the existing exercise database
7. ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes

## üìÅ **Files to Create/Modify**

### **New Files:**
```
app/controllers/api/v1/ai_workout_routines_controller.rb
app/services/ai_workout_routine_service.rb
app/services/ai_api_client.rb
spec/controllers/api/v1/ai_workout_routines_controller_spec.rb
spec/services/ai_workout_routine_service_spec.rb
spec/services/ai_api_client_spec.rb
```

### **Modified Files:**
```
config/routes.rb
Gemfile (if adding HTTP client gems)
```

---

## üîç **Technical Considerations**

### **Database Integration:**
- Use existing `Exercise` model for validation
- Exercise IDs in AI response must exist in the database
- Current database has 873+ exercises imported from free-exercise-db

### **Performance:**
- AI API calls may take 5-15 seconds
- Consider implementing async processing for better UX
- Add timeout limits (30-60 seconds)

### **Error Scenarios:**
1. **Invalid Input:** Age out of range, invalid equipment types
2. **AI Service Down:** External API unavailable
3. **Malformed Response:** AI returns invalid HTML/JSON
4. **Invalid Exercise IDs:** AI suggests non-existent exercises
5. **Timeout:** AI service takes too long to respond

### **Security:**
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent prompt injection
- Validate exercise IDs to prevent database attacks
- Rate limit to prevent abuse

---

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Tests:**
- Service classes with mocked external API calls
- Input validation with various valid/invalid scenarios
- Response parsing with different AI response formats

### **Integration Tests:**
- Full controller flow with stubbed AI responses
- Error handling scenarios
- Authentication flow (if implemented)

### **Manual Testing:**
- Test with actual AI service during development
- Verify Spanish explanations are coherent
- Test with different user profiles and equipment combinations

---

## üìù **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] ‚úÖ Endpoint accepts JSON input with all required fields
- [ ] ‚úÖ Input validation returns clear error messages
- [ ] ‚úÖ AI prompt is correctly formatted and sent to external service
- [ ] ‚úÖ AI response is parsed correctly to extract explanation and routine
- [ ] ‚úÖ Exercise IDs are validated against the database
- [ ] ‚úÖ Success response includes both explanation (Spanish) and routine (JSON)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Error handling covers all major failure scenarios
- [ ] ‚úÖ Response times are reasonable (< 60 seconds)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Unit and integration tests achieve >90% coverage
- [ ] ‚úÖ Documentation is updated with API endpoint details

## üöÄ **Future Enhancements**

1. **Routine Storage:** Save generated routines to user's profile
2. **Routine Customization:** Allow users to modify AI-generated routines
3. **Progress Tracking:** Integrate with existing workout tracking system
4. **Multiple AI Models:** Support different AI providers for comparison
5. **Caching:** Cache responses for identical user profiles
6. **Analytics:** Track popular equipment combinations and goals

---

## üìö **Technical Analysis & Architecture Insights**

### **Current SmartLift API Structure Analysis:**

**Existing Models:**
- `Exercise` model with 873+ exercises from free-exercise-db
- `Routine` and `RoutineExercise` models for user-created routines
- `Workout`, `WorkoutExercise`, `WorkoutSet` models for tracking
- User authentication with JWT tokens

**Current API Patterns:**
- RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- Nested resources (routines/exercises, workouts/sets)
- Strong parameter validation
- Serialized responses with computed fields

**Integration Points:**
- The AI-generated routine should use the same `routine_exercises_attributes` format as the existing `Routine` model
- Exercise IDs must reference existing exercises in the database
- Response format should be consistent with other API endpoints

### **Recommended Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture:**
   - Keep business logic in service classes
   - Thin controllers that delegate to services
   - Separate concerns: validation, AI communication, response parsing

2. **Error Handling Strategy:**
   - Use Rails' built-in error handling patterns
   - Return consistent error response format
   - Log detailed errors for debugging

3. **Testing Approach:**
   - Mock external AI API calls in tests
   - Use factories for test data generation
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
