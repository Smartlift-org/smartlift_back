# Workout Templates Feature

## Overview
Workout Templates are a more flexible and dynamic version of Routines, designed to provide adaptive workout experiences that automatically progress with the user's fitness journey.

## Key Differences from Routines
- **Dynamic Progression**: Templates automatically adjust weights, sets, and reps based on user performance
- **Exercise Variations**: Instead of fixed exercises, templates can include exercise categories with alternatives
- **Adaptive Rest Periods**: Rest times that adjust based on workout intensity and user recovery patterns
- **Smart Volume Control**: Automatic adjustment of volume (sets x reps) based on user's recovery and progress

## Core Components

### Template Structure
- Base exercise framework
- Progression rules
- Alternative exercise mappings
- Volume adjustment parameters
- Rest period calculations

### Progression Engine
- Performance tracking
- Weight increment rules
- Deload protocols
- Volume optimization

### Exercise Substitution System
- Exercise categorization
- Equipment-based alternatives
- Difficulty progression mapping
- Muscle group balance maintenance

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Structure
```ruby
Template
  - name
  - difficulty_level
  - target_muscle_groups
  - progression_rules
  - deload_rules

TemplateBlock
  - template_id
  - exercise_category
  - target_sets_range
  - target_reps_range
  - rest_period_rules
  - alternative_exercises

ProgressionRule
  - condition_type
  - threshold
  - adjustment_type
  - adjustment_value
```

### Key Features for V1
1. Basic template creation
2. Simple progression rules
3. Exercise alternatives
4. Basic performance tracking

### Future Enhancements
1. AI-driven progression
2. Advanced deload protocols
3. Recovery-based adjustments
4. Integration with wearable data
5. Personalized adaptation algorithms

## Technical Requirements
- Enhanced exercise categorization system
- Performance tracking metrics
- Rule engine for progression logic
- Template versioning system

## User Experience Considerations
- Template difficulty ratings
- Progress visualization
- Exercise variation suggestions
- Performance feedback system

This feature will be implemented after the core workout tracking system is stable and user feedback has been gathered from the routine system.
